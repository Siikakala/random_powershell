# Vectorama info screen things
2022 I challenged myself to do ASCII animation for Vectorama parties' big screen. with powershell. People liked it so re-did
it on 2023 with fancier and more modular ASCII and ANSI graphics. Will probably do something in year 2024 too.

You can run the scripts in inifine loop as follows:
2022:
```powershell
while($true){.\vectorama_2022-nyancat.ps1}
```
2023:
```powershell
.\vectorama2023.ps1 -InfiniteLoop
```
